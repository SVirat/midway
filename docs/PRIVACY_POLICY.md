- **Database:** Your data is stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled. Signed-in users can only access their own data.

- **Location precision:** When your coordinates appear in analytics, they are rounded to approximately 1 km precision.
- **API keys:** Sensitive API keys (AI providers) are stored server-side and never exposed to your browser.
- **Encryption:** All data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS.

| Analytics events | Retained indefinitely for aggregate analysis |
| Session metrics | Retained indefinitely |
| Client error logs | Retained indefinitely |
